# ELEC-390-Logistic-Regression-ML-Walking-or-Jumping-Prediction-Model
The project involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer data in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The output CSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier.
