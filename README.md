# ELEC-390-Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning-Walking-or-Jumping-Prediction-Model
Goal:
The goal of the project is to build a desktop app that can distinguish between ‘walking’ and
‘jumping’ with a reasonable accuracy, using the data collected from the accelerometers of a
smartphone.
Description:
The project involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer
data (x, y, and z axes) in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The output
CSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For
classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier, i.e., logistic regression.
In order to accomplish the goal of the final project and complete the report, the following 7 steps
are required:
1. Data collection
2. Data storing
3. Visualization
4. Pre-processing
5. Feature extraction
6. Training the model
7. Creating a simple desktop application with a simple UI that shows the output
